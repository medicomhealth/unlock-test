# README

This is a basic rails blog app where you can create posts with a title and body. Currently you can create and view posts, but not edit or delete. Run the migrations to set up the database and create an example post.

You will be responsible for doing the following:
* Add two endpoints for editing and deleting posts
* Fix any security issues in the existing methods
* Add a new "author" field to the create form

Fork this repo, and create a pull request with all your changes. Thanks!
